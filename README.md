Aim of this repository is to create an annotated dataset which can be used for training Urdu OCR models. 

The final dataset will be freely available to use and uploaded in this repo.


To minimise the manual effort needed for such a task, we are leveraging the texts available on Rekhta, where this manual effort has already been put in. 

The page number and the book (pdf) containing these texts is also available on Rekhta.

Above texts are in the texts folder, organised by poet/author name.

The pdfs/images are in sources folder. If the size grows large we will replace them by a drive link.

The scripts needed are in the code folder.


This initiative is thanks to the collaboration of [OpenITI](https://openiti.org) team with [Rekhta](https://www.rekhta.org).
